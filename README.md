SpectreScan: Advanced Web Log Attack Detection

Detection Mechanisms in scan.py

The scan.py file processes web server logs to identify patterns associated with known attack techniques. It examines HTTP requests, user-agent headers, payloads, and anomaly detection metrics to classify potential threats.
1. Bot Traffic Detection ü§ñ

    Indicators: High-frequency requests from the same IP, odd user-agent strings, and behavior mimicking web scraping.

    Mitigation: Identifies bot-like traffic by analyzing request intervals and detecting automation patterns.

2. SQL Injection (SQLi) Attempts üõ°

    Indicators: Requests containing suspicious SQL keywords (SELECT, UNION, DROP, etc.), encoded payloads, or unexpected database interactions.

    Mitigation: Flags abnormal query structures and recommends query sanitization.

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attempts üé≠

    Indicators: <script> tags, JavaScript payloads within input fields, or attempts to inject executable code into web forms.

    Mitigation: Detects XSS payloads and alerts developers to tighten input validation.

4. HTTP Header Manipulation üì°

    Indicators: Tampered User-Agent, Referer, or Origin headers attempting to bypass security controls.

    Mitigation: Identifies malicious headers and recommends enforcing strict security policies.

5. Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attempts ‚ö†Ô∏è

    Indicators: Requests containing shell commands (rm -rf, wget, curl, etc.) or attempts to execute system functions remotely.

    Mitigation: Detects execution attempts and suggests disabling unsafe functions in web applications.

6. Malicious File Upload Attempts üìÇ

    Indicators: Suspicious file extensions (.php, .exe, .jsp), encoded payload delivery
